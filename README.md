Hi 👋 My name is Kaushik Paul (he/him)
=============================

Software Developer & Student
----------------------------

Started learning all about computers and programming nifty little projects since middle school! What started out as making cool discoveries lead to a career I wanted to pursue. Talk to me all about projects, coding problems and LEGO! (I like collecting LEGO)

*   🌍  Based in Toronto/Ottawa (Move around a bit for school!)
*   ✉️  You can contact me at [kxushikp@proton.me](mailto:kxushikp@proton.me)
*   🧠  I'm currently finding my way through TypeScript, anyone who says they like TSX is lying.
*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on almost anything, hmu
